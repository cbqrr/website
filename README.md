# Sample Website 

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), I would recommend it. They also have an [*email list*](http://learnenough.com/email-list). 
After finishing Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous, you'll know enough to be *dangerous*. This means that you will be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.

They also have additional courses for Python, Ruby, etc.

For more information on Git, see the
[official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
